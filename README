Metaphore is a semantically enriched,
Django-based, cross-media, publication
platform. It is right now in a very
early state of development so expect
more information soon.

A stable release is not to be expected
within less than half a year but feel
free to check out our demo application.

Metaphore is release under the GPL
version 3.
