- Change 'post' into 'publication'
  This is a publication framework, not just a blog thingy.
  
- Better comments than django.contrib.comments
  Users should be blockable by IP, hostname and rate.
  Basic code for this is ready.
  
- Integration of CAPTCHA in all anonymous and some non-
  anonymous user input.
  Basis for this is ready as well but needs updates.
  
- Linkback support. We want to see who links to us.

- OpenID and/or Google auth support. It will be standard. 
  This is what users want, eventually.

Indexing
========
Content should be accessible by the following mechanisms:
- Tagging
  Posts should be easily taggable, both from admin as well
  as from the frontside. Use AJAX.
  
- Categories
  A post should be categorizeable: ManyToMany.
  
- Date
  Ordering by date.
  
- Permalink
  A permalink using the ID of the post object should also be
  available.
  
- Linking
  All types of posts can be connected through links or 
  relations. Right now there is a weird BUG that doesn't
  allow links to be saved.
  
Content types
=============
- LaTeX
  PDF, HTML and text views should be available.
  
- HTML
  Including Javascript WYSIWYG HTML editor.
  
- Downloads
  Including file size info and possibly integrated
  Django S3 support.

- YouTube movies
  Using Google API.
  
- Flickr/Picasaweb photo's and/or gallery's
  Using respective API's.
  
- MP4 movies
  Including transcoding to Flash and automatic web player.
  
- MP3/AAC music
  Also including automatic player.

- Native gallery's based on some existing Django app?

Any other requests?
